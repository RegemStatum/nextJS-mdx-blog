    ## About Sass

      <Image
      src="/images/posts/scss/scss.png"
      placeholder="blur"

      alt="react"

      height="120"
    />

    Sass is&nbsp;a&nbsp;stylesheet language that&rsquo;s compiled to&nbsp;CSS. It&nbsp;allows you to&nbsp;use variables, nested rules, mixins, functions, and more, all with a&nbsp;fully CSS-compatible syntax. Sass helps keep large stylesheets well-organized and makes it&nbsp;easy to&nbsp;share design within and across projects.

     Sass is great!
