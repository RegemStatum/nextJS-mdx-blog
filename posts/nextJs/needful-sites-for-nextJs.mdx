    ## Some info

    Contrary to&nbsp;popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is&nbsp;not simply random text. It&nbsp;has roots in&nbsp;a&nbsp;piece of&nbsp;classical Latin literature from 45&nbsp;BC, making it&nbsp;over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a&nbsp;Latin professor at&nbsp;Hampden-Sydney College in&nbsp;Virginia, looked up&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a&nbsp;Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of&nbsp;the word in&nbsp;classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of&nbsp;&laquo;de&nbsp;Finibus Bonorum et&nbsp;Malorum&raquo; (The Extremes of&nbsp;Good and Evil) by&nbsp;Cicero, written in&nbsp;45&nbsp;BC. This book is&nbsp;a&nbsp;treatise on&nbsp;the theory of&nbsp;ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of&nbsp;Lorem Ipsum, &laquo;Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..&raquo;, comes from a&nbsp;line in&nbsp;section 1.10.32.
