### About me

Lorem Ipsum is&nbsp;simply dummy text of&nbsp;the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry&rsquo;s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an&nbsp;unknown printer took a&nbsp;galley of&nbsp;type and scrambled it&nbsp;to&nbsp;make a&nbsp;type specimen book. It&nbsp;has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It&nbsp;was popularised in&nbsp;the 1960s with the release of&nbsp;Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of&nbsp;Lorem Ipsum.

### What are my posts about?

It&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;long established fact that a&nbsp;reader will be&nbsp;distracted by&nbsp;the readable content of&nbsp;a&nbsp;page when looking at&nbsp;its layout. The point of&nbsp;using Lorem Ipsum is&nbsp;that it&nbsp;has a&nbsp;more-or-less normal distribution of&nbsp;letters, as&nbsp;opposed to&nbsp;using &rsquo;Content here, content here&rsquo;, making it&nbsp;look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as&nbsp;their default model text, and a&nbsp;search for &rsquo;lorem ipsum&rsquo; will uncover many web sites still in&nbsp;their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by&nbsp;accident, sometimes on&nbsp;purpose (injected humour and the like).
